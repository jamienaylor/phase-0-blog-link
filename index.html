            1) What went well? Key Learning.
        </h2>
        <p>
The thing i found in which i suprised myself with was the ability to adapt to and learn the basic git elements, commands and language. This is something i enjoyed as i found it extremely rewarding.
<br><br>
I also enjoyed the HTML labs, and i found that the biggest and best tool for me to use was Google.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            2) What could have been improved?
        </h2>
        <p>
An area i have somewhat lagged in is the CSS language, and referncing that back to the HTML file. I have a lot to learn in this area still before i feel somewhat confident. The varying class references were probably my biggest challenge, however with the assitance of Google i did manage to write some ok code for my web page.
        </p>
    
        <h2>
            3) The key take aways.
        </h2>
        <p>
The key take away for me through this first phase of training was the fact that i was still able to succeed on labs even though i may not have known how to complete them without in depth assitance from Google. I still feel like im a long way from a confidence level of which ill be happy with, however i dont doubt i will eventually make it to a position im happy with. 
        </p>
        <h2>
         4) The process you followed?
        </h2>  
        <p>
The process i followed and found easiest was to ensure i took each lab step by step, and often as i progressed onto another lab i would keep the previous one open as i knew the new lab would be building off the previous one. 
<br><br>
I managed to find myself in a routine for opening repositories that worked well for me, and i just tried to mimic the data and content that was provided within the labs so that i had an easy and direct reference for things when ever i got stuck. If i had of changed content i dont think i would have been able to come to terms with understanding the labs as quickly as i did.
